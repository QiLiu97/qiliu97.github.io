I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in [the SPCOMNAV group](https://spcomnav.uab.es/) at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), working with **Prof. Gonzalo Seco-Granados** and **Prof. José A. López-Salcedo** in the field of advanced positioning technologies. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Geomatics Engineering in 2019 and my Ph.D. in Traffic Mapping and Information Technology in 2024, both from Southeast University, China. My doctoral research focused on key technologies of smartphone adaptive positioning for multiple scenarios. Recently, my research interests lie in the field of satellite and terrestrial positioning using GNSS and 5G technologies, now extended with the use of LEO satellites, either for dedicated PNT or as a source of signals of opportunity (SOP).

My long-term goal is to develop resilient, multi-layer positioning systems that seamlessly integrate satellite, terrestrial, and opportunistic signals to support autonomous systems and next-generation intelligent transportation.

For more details, please refer to my [CV](/cv/). I warmly welcome collaboration and academic exchange.
